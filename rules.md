***__Rules__***

These are the rules that are constantly effective in our Discord server (currently named "So Long Gay Bowser"). 

__**Rules of Order**__
- **Rule A1:**
Refrain from posting spam.
- **Rule A2:**
NSFW and NSFL content is not allowed. 
- **Rule A3:**
Use the server's channels for their respective purposes. 
- **Rule A4:**
All A-rules, except for rule A1 are ineffective in #hell. 

__**Rules of Ranks**__ 
- **Rule B1:**
Everyone in SLGB has a Rank. A member's Rank is always the role they possess that is placed the highest on the following list: 
1. Server Owner
2. @Administrator
3. @Moderator
4. @Menneske
5. Kicked from SLGB
6. Banned from SLGB
- **Rule B2:**
Any member may, at any time, request a Demotion of any server member whose Rank is not 1 (Server Owner). When a Demotion is requested, a vote will be open for all server members for minimum 6 hours, and maximum 24 hours. 
In this vote, the options will be "0", "1" and "2". 
When the vote is over, the aforementioned server member will be Demoted to a Rank that is as much lower than their current Rank as the option that had the most votes.
While this vote is ongoing, the aforementioned server member will be "suspended". A suspended server member's Rank is 4 (@Menneske) until the vote is over.
- **Rule B3:** 
Any member may, at any time, request a Promotion of any server member. When a Promotion is requested, a vote will be open for all server members for minimum 6 hours, and maximum 24 hours. 
In this vote, the options will be "0", "1" and "2". 
When the vote is over, the aforementioned server member will be Promoted to a Rank that is as much higher than their current Rank as the option that had the most votes. 
All HRSMs must be in unanimous agreement before a server member is promoted. 
A member can not be Promoted to Rank 1 (Server Owner) if the Promotion is originally activated by this rule (B3). 

__**Rules of Ownership**__ 
- **Rule C1 - Becoming a Candidate:** 
Any server member may, at any time, request to become a Candidate. An HRSM will, upon such a request, grant the requesting server member the @Kandidat role. 
All Candidates have access to writing in #election. Every Candidate is to post 1 message each in #election before the next Election is held.
All excessive messages are to be deleted. 
- **Rule C2 - Time of Election:** 
The first Election is held on November 1. 2019. 
Any server member may request that an Election is to be held on a specific date. A vote is, upon such a request, to be opened by the Server Owner (member Ranked 1), where it is decided whether or not the next Election will be held on the requested date. 
This vote is to be open for minimum 6 hours, and maximum 24 hours. 
An Election can not be held if less than 4 months have passed since the previous Election was held. 
- **Rule C3 - Voting and Aftermath of Election:**
During the date that was chosen through Rule C2, any server member may react to any of the messages in #election with :white_check_mark:. Candidates may also vote, but voting for oneself is a Lawbreak of level 1. 
During the day *after* this date, the Server Owner (member Ranked 1) is to count votes. The Candidate whose message in #election has the most :white_check_mark: reactions when the votes are counted, is to be promoted to Rank 1. 
This means that the server member who is currently Ranked 1, has to transfer ownership of SLGB to the "winning" Candidate. 
Should a tie occur, no change in ownership will be made. 

__**Rules of Jobs**__ 
- **Rule D1 - bla bla job:**
bla bla get job bla bla do job stuff



__**Miscellaneous Rules:**__ 
- **Rule X1 - New Members:** 
Any server member may, at any time, request that a new member is invited to SLGB. Upon such a request, a vote will be initiated. If the majority of server members vote *for* inviting the member to SLGB, the member is to be invited.
