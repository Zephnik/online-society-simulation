***__Rules__***

These are the rules that are constantly effective in our Discord server (currently named "So Long Gay Bowser"). 

__**Rules of Order**__
- **Rule A1:**
Refrain from posting spam.
- **Rule A2:**
NSFW and NSFL content is not allowed. 
- **Rule A3:**
Use the server's channels for their respective purposes. 
- **Rule A4:**
All A-rules, except for rule A1 are ineffective in #hell. 

__**Rules of Ranks**__ 
- **Rule B1:**
Everyone in SLGB has a Rank. A member's Rank is always the role they possess that is placed the highest on the following list: 
1. Server Owner
2. @Administrator
3. @Moderator
4. @Menneske
5. Kicked from SLGB
6. Banned from SLGB
- **Rule B2:**
Any member may, at any time, request a Demotion of any server member whose Rank is not 1 (Server Owner). When a Demotion is requested, a vote will be open for all server members for at least 6 hours, and maximum 24 hours. 
In this vote, the options will be "0", "1" and "2". 
When the vote is over, the aforementioned server member will be Demoted to a Rank that is as much lower than their current Rank as the option that had the most votes.
While this vote is ongoing, the aforementioned server member will be "suspended". A suspended server member's Rank is 4 (@Menneske) until the vote is over.
- **Rule B3:** 
Any member may, at any time, request a Promotion of any server member. When a Promotion is requested, a vote will be open for all server members for at least 6 hours, and maximum 24 hours. 
In this vote, the options will be "0", "1" and "2". 
When the vote is over, the aforementioned server member will be Promoted to a Rank that is as much higher than their current Rank as the option that had the most votes. 
All HRSMs must be in unanimous agreement before a server member is promoted. 
A member can not be Promoted to Rank 1 (Server Owner) if the Promotion is originally activated by this rule (B3). 

__**Rules of Ownership**__ 
- **Rule C1:** 
bla bla ownership bla bla election

__**List of Legal Terms:**__

Anything sexual counts as "NSFW", while anything gory/disturbing counts as "NSFL".
