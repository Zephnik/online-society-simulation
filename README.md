# Online Society Simulation
This is some sort of a Nomic game that simulates a society and helps govern our thriving, private Discord server. 
The repository was created to keep track of the rules in our beautiful server. 
This is where everybody goes to see how to get/lose authority, how to spend their virtual money and even how to change the course of our entire project.
