# Online Society Simulation
This is a project that simulates a society and helps govern our thriving, private Discord server. 
The repository was created to keep track of the rules in our beautiful server. 
This is where you go to see how to gain/lose authority, how to spend your virtual money and even how to change the course of our entire server.
