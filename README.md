# Online Society Simulation

This is a project that simulates a society and helps govern our thriving, private Discord server. 
The repository was created to keep track of the rules in our beautiful server. 
This is where you go to see how to gain/lose authority, how to spend your virtual money and even how to change the course of our entire server. 

Here's what you can expect to find in our documents: 
- **https://github.com/Zephnik/online-society-simulation/blob/master/rules.md**: 
This is where we store our rules. It's the core document that keeps the whole server going. 
- **https://github.com/Zephnik/online-society-simulation/blob/master/legal-terms.md**: 
Here, you can find a list of "legal terms". These are keywords and abbreviations with legal definitions that are used in the ruleset. 
- **https://github.com/Zephnik/online-society-simulation/blob/master/bank.md**: 
In the Bank, one can go to see all current balances. A server member's "balance" is how much money they currently possess. 
The currency we use in SLGB is called "numies" (~~n~~). All members initially have ~~N~~100.
